# Help and support

As explained elsewhere on this website, MIMIC is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. 

We therefore encourage MIMIC users to work together as a community. Please read [our notes on how to get involved](/community/contributing/) for further information.

# Contact us

Where possible we encourage public discussion via the methods described at: http://mimic.physionet.org/community/contributing/. 

MIMIC is a complex dataset and we understand that there are many open questions, both in terms of the data and its analysis. Public discussion reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and reduces workload on our laboratory. 

One exception is where a topic is sensitive, for example relating to patient health information. If you need to raise a private issue, please contact us at: [mimic-support@physionet.org](mailto:mimic-support@physionet.org).
