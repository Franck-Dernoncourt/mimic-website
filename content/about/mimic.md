# MIMIC-III Critical Care Database

MIMIC-III is a large, openly-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. 

The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and out-of-hospital mortality.

MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors:

- it is publicly and freely available
- it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients
- it contains high temporal resolution data including lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms.
