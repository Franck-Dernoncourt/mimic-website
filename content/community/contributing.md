# Contributions and questions

MIMIC is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. We therefore encourage MIMIC users to work together as a community.

## How can I get help with my analysis?

If you are seeking advice for a specific question, we would suggest either:

- posting your question to the [Open Data StackExchange](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/), labelled with "mimic-iii" as one of the keywords. For example, see the following question about diabetic patients: http://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/6182/gold-annotations-for-diabetic-patients-in-mimic-iii
- posting your question as an issue in the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues)
- holding on until the [forthcoming forum](/community/forum/) has been created.

## How can I help to improve the MIMIC website and documentation?

The MIMIC website and documentation are hosted publicly in GitHub (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website). 

To raise a problem or to suggest an improvement, please create a new issue at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website/issues

To fix an issue or to contribute new content, please either select the 'Edit this page' item in the left hand menu of the website or [submit a pull request in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## How can I share code that I have written for MIMIC?

We have worked hard to create and share the MIMIC dataset. In return, we encourage you to share the code that you use for analysing the data.

Please add your code to the MIMIC Code Repository at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code. The structure of the repository will develop over time as new contributions are made.

## How can I highlight an issue relating to the MIMIC dataset?

If you identify an issue with the MIMIC data (for example, unusual characteristics or limitations), one useful step would be to add your finding to the documentation, via the method described above.

For concerns about errors in the database, including private health information which has not been sufficiently de-identified, please contact us directly at [mimic-support@physionet.org](mailto:mimic-support@physionet.org).
