# MIMIC III

The latest version of MIMIC is MIMIC III v1.0 consisting of nearly 58,000 hospital admissions corresponding to over 48,000 distinct patients. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012. MIMIC II contained ICU clinical data from 2001 to 2008; MIMIC III extends the data set to October of 2012 by integrating two ICU databases. See [our documentation on what's new](/mimicdata/whatsnew/) for more detail.

# Getting access

The MIMIC II Waveform Database (bedside monitor trends and waveforms) is freely available. See [http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/](http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/) for further information.

The MIMIC Clinical Database, although de-identified, still contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of patients, and must be treated with appropriate care and respect. Researchers seeking to use the database must formally request access by following these steps:

- Follow [the instructions](https://physionet.org/pnw/login) to create and log in to a PhysioNetWorks account. If you already have a PhysioNetWorks account, [log in to it](https://physionet.org/pnw/login).
- On your PhysioNetWorks home page, click on the link titled "MIMIC III Clinical Database", and follow the instructions to apply for access.

All applications are reviewed, and if yours is approved you will receive separate emails containing instructions for downloading the database from PhysioNetWorks. Note that approval usually requires at least a week, and will be delayed if your request is missing any required information.
