# Issues

The forum provides a platform for any questions regarding data extraction.
If you believe there is an error in the data extraction that you feel is due to the process of deidentification or due to the export of the data from its various sources to MIMIC, please report it on the GitHub issues page:

(TBD).

Please read through the issues to ensure you are not duplicating a previous report.

# Contact us

A key component of research on the openly available MIMIC database is the community.
MIMIC is a complex dataset, and when everyone contributes their knowledge in an open platform it galvanizes research into all aspects of the database.
Given this, we strongly discourage e-mails, as this knowledge is rarely disseminated to the general public.

If you have a question regarding the database, please see the forum (TBD).

If you have an issue to report regarding the data, please report it on the GitHub issues page (TBD).

If you have an issue regarding the website, please report it on the GitHub issues page:
https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website/issues

Otherwise, we can be contacted at [mimic-support@physionet.org](mailto:mimic-support@physionet.org).
