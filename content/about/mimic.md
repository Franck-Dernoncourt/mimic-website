# MIMIC-III Critical Care Database

MIMIC-III is a large, openly available database sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The data collected centers around the intensive care unit (ICU), an area of the hospital which cares for acutely ill patients. Due to the high level of monitoring of ICU patients, a large amount of information is documented in the electronic data management system. This information has been made openly available with the hope that it can provide further insight into clinical care. The MIMIC database is notable for three factors

- it is publicly and freely available
- it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients
- it contains high temporal resolution data including lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms. 

The database can support a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development.
