# Contributing

We welcome contributions to MIMIC; both in the form of source code and corrections regarding the patient data. We highly encourage users of the database to contribute their source code to our [openly available GitHub repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/). We hope that by simplifying access to data extractions and analyses done by previous users, current and future users will be able to rapidly build upon and extend research into the database.

We also welcome any improvements suggested regarding this documentation or the database. This documentation is hosted entirely on GitHub here, and we welcome pull requests. For concerns about errors in the database, including private health information which has not been sufficiently de-identified, please contact us at [mimic-support@physionet.org](mailto:mimic-support@physionet.org).
